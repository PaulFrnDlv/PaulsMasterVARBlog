## Welcome to Paul's blog !

My name is Paul Fournier--Delouvée and I am a student in the last year of engineering school Télécom SudParis in Evry.
I am specialized in the imagery and artificial intelligence fields.
This year, I have the chance to follow the VAR master, an IPP master 2 dedicated to the virtual and augmented reality.
This blog is the place where you could see all the projects I had during this master.

Enjoy !
